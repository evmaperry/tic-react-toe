# Welcome to 'Tic-React-Toe', the name of which barely edged out the first runner-up, 'React-Tac-Toe', and the second runner up, 'You will tie', by a hair.
## Introduction

I wrote this app while on sabbatical (that's a long story) from the bootcamp I've/I'd been attending, called Operation Spark in New Orleans. (Quick shout-out to OpSpark, they're the sauce.)

Tic-React-Toe is my first proper React app. It leans on React's class components, which I understand to be out-of-style these days but was nevertheless the starting point for our working with React at Operation Spark. My thinking was it'd be good practice (and it was!).

The app is static to the max and does not (yet) feature any server-side functionality, but that may someday come.

## Set-up

...is not too complicated. You and your opponent add your names into the player inputs, select your markers (X or O; will auto-adjust the other radio), and choose how many rounds determine the victor. Click 'Start Session' and you're off to the races. Keep an eye on the stats and message panel, which update to guide players through the game.
## How to play

Player 1 starts the first game of each session, and then the starter alternates every game for best-of3 or -5 sessions. A button invoking a board reset appears once a game concludes, and you're gonna press that if you want to keep playing (if not, that's totally cool, too, you can close the window and move on with your life).

Otherwise you're trying to align 3 of your tokens in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal orientation. But so it your opponent! And that's why you'll tie. Good luck!
